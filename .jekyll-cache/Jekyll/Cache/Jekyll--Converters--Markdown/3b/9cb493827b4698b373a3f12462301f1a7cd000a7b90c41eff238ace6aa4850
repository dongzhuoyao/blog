<p>Enhancing expressivity of normalising flows is not easy, since we are constrained by functions, whose Jacobians are easy to compute.
It turns out, though, that we can introduce dependencies between different dimensions of the latent variable, and still end up with a tractable Jacobian.
Namely, if after a transformation, the dimension <script type="math/tex">i</script> of the resulting variable depends only on dimensions <script type="math/tex">1:i</script> of the input variable, then the Jacobian of this transformation is triangular.
As we know, a Jacobian of a triangular matrix is equal to the product of the terms on the diagonal.
More formally, let <script type="math/tex">J \in \mathcal{R}^{d \times d}</script> be the Jacobian of the mapping <script type="math/tex">f</script>, then</p>

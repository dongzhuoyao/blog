  <li>Of the aforementioned work, FixMatch bears the closest

Augmentation (UDA) [45] and ReMixMatch [2].</li>
  <li>………….  We find that to obtain strong results, especially in
the limited-label regime, certain design choices are often
underemphasized – most importantly, weight decay and the
choice of optimizer. The importance of these factors means
that even when controlling for model architecture as is recommended in [31], the same technique can not always be
directly compared across different implementations.</li>

<p><strong>Consistency regularization</strong></p>

<p>Consistency regularization (Sajjadi et al., 2016b; Laine &amp; Aila, 2017; Miyato et al., 2017; Oliver
et al., 2018) describes a class of semi-supervised learning algorithms that have yielded state-ofthe-art results in semi-supervised classification, while being conceptually simple and often easy to
implement. The key idea is to encourage the network to give consistent predictions for unlabeled
inputs that are perturbed in various ways.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://openreview.net/forum?id=B1eBoJStwr">CowMix, Semi-supervised semantic segmentation needs strong, high-dimensional perturbations </a></strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The use of a rectangular mask restricts the dimensionality of the perturbations that CutOut and
CutMix can produce. Intuitively, a more complex mask that has more degrees of freedom should
provide better exploration of the plausible input space. We propose combining the semantic CutOut
and CutMix regularizers introduced above with a novel mask generation method, giving rise to two
regularization methods that we dub CowOut and CowMix due to the Friesian cow -like texture of
the masks.</p>
